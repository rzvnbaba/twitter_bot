# Twitter Automation
### Automatic following action
For correct use on your PC you need to install Python, Robot Framework, Firefox Driver, Selenium Library and JSON Library (Robot Framework libraries).
For the respective installation and user guides, refer to the official documentation of each tool. </br></br>
This script is for <strong>educational purposes only</strong>. It is not affiliated with the Twitter platform and the contributors of the repository are not responsible for the consequences of its use. </br></br>
### Automations
The script is able to log in autonomously on the Twitter platform, reach a chosen account and start following the followers accounts of the account just reached.</br></br>
The follow actions on the list of accounts it will find are done with a temporal distance of 60 seconds from each other, to simulate human behavior.</br>
The maximum number of loops is 400, which can be configured differently by giving a different parameter to the FOR loop.</br></br>
The repository is not actively maintained and the script will not follow Twitter interface updates.
